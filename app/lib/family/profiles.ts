 *   that profile wins (in practice this never differs — a profile's
 *   name/color are set once at creation and never mutated — but a
 *   deterministic tie-break is still needed).
 * - Bests: union by board+player, keeping the better score per `lowerBoards`
 *   direction. Reuses recordBest so "better" has exactly one definition in
 *   the codebase — this function does not re-implement that comparison.
 * - activeId: `incoming`'s choice wins (it reflects the most recent
 *   interaction on the tab doing the saving), falling back to `disk`'s.
 * - Tombstones: union by id, keeping the later timestamp when both sides
 *   recorded one. Any profile (and any bests entry) whose id is tombstoned
 *   on either side is dropped from the result — a plain union of profiles
 *   has no way to represent "this one was deleted," so without this step a
 *   removal made on one side always gets resurrected by the other side's
